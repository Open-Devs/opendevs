hi everyone, üëã
today we‚Äôll have a look at great tool that enables us to download aws s3 data smartly. üë®‚Äçüíª

## so what is this tool?

this project enables downloading data from s3 a breeze, it has 3 modes _(CLI mode, Interactive mode & Download All mode)_ using which you can download _aws s3 bucket_ files into default or custom path.<br/>
If you choose the same directory as previous time, it'll `sync` those changes.

> It now supports setting of aws config like AWS Access key ID, AWS Secret key, AWS region & Output format in interactive mode
